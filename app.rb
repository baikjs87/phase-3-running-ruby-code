# Ruby comes with a tool called IRB (Interactive Ruby) for running a Ruby REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) in the terminal, which provides similar functionality to the browser console that you're familiar with from JavaScript.
# Using IRB is a great way to quickly test out some code, or check your syntax, without needing to run an entire application.
